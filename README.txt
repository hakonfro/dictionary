Use javac *.java to compile 
start program with java Start 

The programs main functionality is to implement a binary search tree of strings. In this case I have chosen a dictionary consisting of 75000 words. 

Then the user can search for a word, if it doesn't exist, the program will give suggestions. To quit use the letter 'q'. The program will then 

print information about the binary tree.
